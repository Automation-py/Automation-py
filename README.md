## ðŸš€ About Me
I started coding about three years ago when COVID-19 occurred, and I have learned how to automate account creation using Selenium and Request.


# Who is This Page For?

I made this GitHub page to share the knowledge I've acquired over the past three years with everyone for free, as others have done so with YouTube videos that did not get them far.
I started learning by myself and have accomplished some great success. Over time, I've automated various websites and apps such as Instagram, Tiktok, Snapchat, Discord and more. Needless to say it wasn't easy. There was no guide out there nor any platform really explained and helped me understand how to automate anything I wanted, so I spent years learning myselfâ€”and now I'm proud to say that I have a good understanding on how to automate anything I want.
